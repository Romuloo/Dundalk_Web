        <h3> The perfect destination for your Erasmus </h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Dundalk</strong> is one of the most historical parts of Ireland with Louth
            known as the <em>land of legends</em>. Rich in heritage, many of the famous Irish
            legends and epics were based in the wonderful landscape here. It enjoys a great location,
            strategically located approximately midway between the two largest cities in the island of Ireland,
            <strong>Belfast</strong> and <strong>Dublin</strong>. It sits where the Castletown River flows into Dundalk Bay. The town is close
            to the border with Northern Ireland and equi-distant from Dublin and Belfast.</p>
